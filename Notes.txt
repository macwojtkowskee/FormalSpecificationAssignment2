Channels:
Controller/System:
change_bin - asynchronous, two-mtype variables of pos (closed/open) and comp (OuterDoor, LockOuterDoor, TrapDoor)
bin_changed - synchronous, channel for acknowledgments; hence of type comp (specifying which door component has been changed) 
    + boolean value designating if something has been changed.
user_closed_outer_door - synchronous, acknowledgments for locking the lock.
weigh_trash - synchronous, bool (if true)
trash_weighted - synchronous, bool


User/Controller:
scan_card_user - consists of a number ID, the reader accepts all numbers except for 42
can_deposit_trash


Controller/Server:
check_user
user_valid

Server/Truck:
request_truck - vu
change_truck

Bin/Controller/Truck
empty_bin
bin_emptied - has to be set to false before issuing command for emptying bin

Abstract behaviour:
1. User/Controller Card Verification:
1.1. User scans card, and a message to check if the card is valid is sent to the controller. [x]
1.2. Controller waits for User's message of checkID, and once it obtains the id, it sends it as a checkID message to Server [x]
1.3. Controller waits for and receives verification of whether or not user ID is valid, and proceeds to step 2 [x]

2. User/Controller Weight-based door opening.
2.1. Controller checks the weight status of the bin, and accordingly sends a message to the user [x]
2.2.
